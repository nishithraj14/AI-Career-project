## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s competitive job market, candidates often struggle to evaluate how effectively their resume represents their skills, experience, and career trajectory. Traditional resume review processes are:

- Manual and time-consuming  
- Subjective and inconsistent  
- Non-interactive  
- Unable to provide instant, personalized feedback  

Once a resume is reviewed, candidates still lack an easy way to ask follow-up questions such as:
- What are my strongest skills?
- Am I suitable for a particular role?
- What improvements can I make to my resume?

There is a clear need for an **automated, intelligent, and interactive system** that can both analyze resumes and answer questions contextually.
